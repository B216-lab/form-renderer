# Supabase Docker

- [Supabase hosting docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/docker)

- Dependant services are updated ~monthly. Updating should be performed frequently to get the latest features and bug fixes and security patches
- Don't use direct connection between front-end and back-end using these sweet "database security rules" or that kind of stuff, because of CVE-2024-45489 and 
increasing complexity of supporting these rules as DB's schema is growing ([look](https://youtu.be/2zcN2aQsUdc?si=80NfsuOA2KI770CH))
